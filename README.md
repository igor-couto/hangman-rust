# Hangman


### Classic hangman game

Your goal is to find out what the word is. Fill in the blanks by guessing one letter at a time to see if it's in the word. If you have guessed correctly, the letter will appear in the blank spaces. Select a letter not in the word, a piece of the hangman will appear. When all the body parts of the hanged man appear, you lose.
